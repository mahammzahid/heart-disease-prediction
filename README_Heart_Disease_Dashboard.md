# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction Dashboard

## 📘 Overview
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a detailed visualization of heart disease prediction data.  
It helps analyze the distribution of heart disease cases across different age groups, chest pain types, and other clinical features.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patient demographics and medical attributes related to heart disease.  
- Compare characteristics of patients **with** and **without** heart disease.  
- Identify **key risk indicators** such as age, chest pain type, MaxHR, and cholesterol.  
- Provide an **interactive filtering experience** for data-driven insights.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

| Metric | Description | Value |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Patients with Heart Disease | Number of individuals diagnosed with heart disease | **508** |
| Patients without Heart Disease | Number of healthy individuals | **410** |
| Total Records | Count of total dataset entries | **918** |

---

## 📈 Visual Insights
- **Age Distribution:** Middle-aged patients (50–60 years) show the highest prevalence of heart disease.  
- **MaxHR Analysis:** Healthy individuals exhibit higher average maximum heart rate levels.  
- **Chest Pain Patterns:** Asymptomatic (ASY) chest pain type is most common among heart disease patients.  
- **Gender Analysis:** Males show a significantly higher number of heart disease cases compared to females.  
- **Cholesterol Comparison:** Slightly lower average cholesterol levels are observed in patients with heart disease.

---

## ⚙️ Filters
The dashboard includes interactive filters for:
- **Chest Pain Type**
- **Sex**
- **ST_Slope**
- **Age**

These allow users to dynamically explore relationships between variables.

---

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** for visualization  
- **Python / Machine Learning Model (SVM, Linear Regression)** for prediction 
- **Dataset:** Heart Disease Dataset (UCI Repository)

---

## 🩸 Key Insights
- Age and MaxHR are **strong indicators** of heart disease.  
- Males are more prone to heart disease in the dataset.  
- Certain chest pain types (ASY) strongly correlate with the presence of heart disease.
